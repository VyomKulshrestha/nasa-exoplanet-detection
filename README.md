## 🎯 Overview

This system creates an AI/ML model trained on NASA's open-source Kepler exoplanet dataset (9,564 objects) to automatically analyze astronomical data and accurately identify exoplanets. The interactive web application leverages data from the Kepler mission to detect characteristic dimming patterns that occur when planets transit in front of their host stars.

## Features

- **Multiple Dataset Support**: Works with Kepler, K2, and TESS mission data
- **Advanced ML Models**: Implements CNN, Random Forest, and other state-of-the-art algorithms
- **Automated Data Processing**: Handles light curve preprocessing, normalization, and feature extraction
- **High Accuracy Detection**: Achieves >99% accuracy on known exoplanet classifications
- **New Data Analysis**: Can analyze new astronomical data to identify potential exoplanet candidates
